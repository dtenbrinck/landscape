# Landscape
This is the official repository for Landscape, a software pipeline for automatic embryo data registration and analysis written in Matlab. 
This software has been developed as cooperation between the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany and the University of Erlangen, Germany since 2015. 
It has been tested and calibrated for three-dimensional voxel data of zebrafish and common fruit fly.

If you don't have any MathWorks Matlab license available you can download a standalone application for Microsoft Windows from http://imaging.am.uni-erlangen.de/files/Landscape_Installer.exe.

In case you have any quesions or ideas for improvement please open an issue or send an email to <daniel.tenbrinck@fau.de>.
