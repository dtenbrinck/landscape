remarks on files in this folder

- heatmap_dynamics, processing_dynamic, evaluation_dynamic 
   should be located directly in the main folder.
Therefore we need to correct the rootdir in those files:
replace: 
root_dir = fileparts(fileparts(pwd));
with: 
root_dir = pwd;

moreover:
- remove the "readoldresults" optionality from processing_dynamics
it is only implemented to avoid long data processing from "static" data when the implementation for dynamic data should be tested anyway

- remove plotting of (un)registered landmarks
