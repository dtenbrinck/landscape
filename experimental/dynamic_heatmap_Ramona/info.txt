remarks on files in this folder

- ParameterProcessing needed because it includes information for embryo estimation which is currently not yet included on the main folder

heatmap_dynamics and processing_dynamic should be located directly in the main folder.
Therefore we need to correct the rootdir in both files:
replace: 
root_dir = fileparts(fileparts(pwd));
with: 
root_dir = pwd;

moreover:
remove the "readoldresults" optionality from processing_dynamics
it is only implemented to avoid long data processing from "static" data when the implementation for dynamic data should be tested anyway
